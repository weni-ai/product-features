# Share your suggestions for Weni product

To do this, you need to have an account created on github.com

Logged on github, you can open this [link](https://github.com/weni-ai/product-features/issues), you will open the issues page on github. On the issues page, you can create a new issue, and this issue will be available for our product teams to work on in the future.

To create a new issue, you need to click on the green button on the right side, after this, you need to generate a title for the problem and a detailed suggestion.
You need to follow the best practices to open a suggestion:

- Title: Try to resume the suggestion in a clear title that easily conveys your idea.
- Description: Describe the problem that you have and provide more details about your thoughts, feel free to use images, videos, and documentation to enrich your idea.
- Label: Select the **enhancement** tag.

In this way, your suggestions don't lose and will be able to prioritize at some point for one of our product teams, and will be linked in our roadmap.
